    To set aside a block of code,
    use four spaces to precede the line.

To denote code inline, add ` before and after the code.

~~To strikeout, use `~` before and after.~~

To __bold__ or _italicize_ something, use one or two underscores (`_`) before and after.

To divide paragraphs
in markdown, you need to
have an empty line
between the two paragraphs.

Otherwise, it will output as a single paragraph.

### To create unordered lists

* Precede each bullet point with `*`, followed by a space
- or `-` followed by a space
 * To create nested unordered lists, add a space before the `*`
 - or before the `-`
 - GitHub only supports one level of nesting

### To create ordered lists

1. Precede each bullet point with `1.`, followed by a space
2. Markdown doesn't require increasing the numeral
9. In fact, it ignores the numeral entirely (this bullet is actually number 9)
3. GitHub, however, automatically does so
 1. To create nested ordered lists, add a space before the `1.`
 2. GitHub only supports one level of nesting
